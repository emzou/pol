	476285315	there is no way that map happens it involves way too many flips of solidly red at picrel from the betting site aggregates its not even i think kamala might be able to flip mi getting her to 260 if she focuses on pa i think will go red especially after the shooting all trump has to do is campaign there a lot ideally in the same venue to remind nv and az are much harder to flip according to betting sites with like a 10 higher prob of going red than mi or az is flippable if she picks the vp from there but i still doubt and nc are even then you also have to consider that wittmer will almost certainly not be her vp she s a decent option for the next go round possibly as the top of the ticket possibly as the vp to newsom or i d estimate approx 0 chance that she concedes to being kamalas number are higher for kelly but i think he too will pass only a huge loser with no real future would accept such a shit job and i do think kelly is most likely i think she ends up with beshear or shapiro and attempts to fight for the rust belt mi wi pa conceding nv az ga nc this is her best shot but she almost certainly loses even with shapiro helping in likely but also possible she tries to split her efforts she picks kelly attempting to flip az and also tries for the rust belt trio this makes it even less likely she wins	2.0	2024-07-30 16:59:16
