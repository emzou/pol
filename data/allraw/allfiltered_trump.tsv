	476285315	there is no way that map happens it involves way too many flips of solidly red at picrel from the betting site aggregates its not even i think kamala might be able to flip mi getting her to 260 if she focuses on pa i think will go red especially after the shooting all trump has to do is campaign there a lot ideally in the same venue to remind nv and az are much harder to flip according to betting sites with like a 10 higher prob of going red than mi or az is flippable if she picks the vp from there but i still doubt and nc are even then you also have to consider that wittmer will almost certainly not be her vp she s a decent option for the next go round possibly as the top of the ticket possibly as the vp to newsom or i d estimate approx 0 chance that she concedes to being kamalas number are higher for kelly but i think he too will pass only a huge loser with no real future would accept such a shit job and i do think kelly is most likely i think she ends up with beshear or shapiro and attempts to fight for the rust belt mi wi pa conceding nv az ga nc this is her best shot but she almost certainly loses even with shapiro helping in likely but also possible she tries to split her efforts she picks kelly attempting to flip az and also tries for the rust belt trio this makes it even less likely she wins	2.0	2024-07-30 16:59:16

	481322505	the situation surrounding project 2025 has recently come under heightened scrutiny especially with the involvement of robert kennedy jr rfk jr and his association with donald trump this project developed by the heritage foundation outlines an extensive conservative agenda that would significantly reshape the government if a republican were to win the presidency in heritage foundation a well known conservative think tank developed project 2025 which is an extensive 900 page agenda outlining conservative priorities the project as described in the analysis aims to fundamentally alter the structure of the federal government including reclassifying federal workers under schedule f reversing abortion rights and eliminating diversity equity and inclusion dei initiatives the project radical agenda has garnered support from various conservative groups and politicians including endorsements that emphasize dismantling the so called administrative state however the contents have also prompted strong reactions from democrats who have labeled it as authoritarian and warned of its potential to lead the country toward a dystopic right wing theocracy	1.0	2024-09-11 07:31:26
	481322585	democrats have seized upon project 2025 as a critical issue to campaign against particularly targeting trumps alleged association with it the biden campaign for instance has used the document to draw sharp contrasts between the democratic and republican visions for america warning of the dire consequences of a trump presidency aligned with the project 2025 agenda this includes claims that trump would revoke reproductive rights and use the presidency to settle personal scores among other authoritarian measures the framing of project 2025 as a blueprint for a radical overhaul of the government has been central to the democratic strategy particularly in appealing to voters who may be alarmed by the implications of such sweeping changes the characterization of the project as un american and a threat to democracy aims to rally opposition and solidify support for the democratic platform is this a political election year maneuver to a significant extent the release and promotion of project 2025 can be seen as an election year maneuver by conservatives to galvanize their base provide a clear policy agenda and contrast their vision with that of the democrats however its not just a stunt project 2025 represents a serious thought out plan to implement conservative principles should republicans win the white house it is designed to serve as a roadmap for the next conservative administration making it more than just an election year gimmick yet the timing and emphasis on the document during the 2024 election cycle highlight its role as a tool for political mobilization and conclusion while trump distancing from project 2025 may be politically expedient to avoid being pigeonholed by its more controversial aspects the project itself is a serious effort by the conservative movement to set the stage for significant policy changes under a future republican administration	1.0	2024-09-11 07:32:15

dxtZQbUL	480501278	released talibanit was a prisoner exchange several thousand afghan prisoners were released as dealthe taliban was pretty close to winning the war at that point and the trump sos was positioning itself to have ins with them once they took over the reading between the lines part of the deal was basically attack our bases when you take over there was also a hush hush agreement for the taliban not to begin their big offensive until us withdrawal was really blame biden for the fall of the afghan government everyone knew that was coming it had no support from the public and they filled their army with women and dei commanders trying to chase western ngo money they were never going to biden fucked up is unilaterally moving the withdrawal date for us forces back by several months basically telling the taliban altering the deal pray i alter it further this is all well and good when you are the stronger side in negotiations but as dod and state department found that was not the us in that particular situation the taliban said fuck it we roll and 13 us soldiers died in a clusterfuck of a retreat	1.0	2024-09-03 09:43:13

dxtZQbUL	480502400	without the actual government presentby that point the afghan government was a failed entity asking why they were present is like asking why ronald mcdonald does attend mcdonalds corporate board meetings the fact that they did everything in the doha accords without so much as a protest should tell you everything you need to taliban were releasedalong with a few thousand afghan government prisoners too ultimately the prisoners would have mattered its hard to overstate just how fucked afghanistans government already was the us position was that the only valuable thing was time for withdrawal and we got it or we did until biden got into office and basically froze it all and then started saying he wanted to stay in afghanistan for some reason up until he got thrown am not some trump sycophant the entire deal was the united states pulling out with our tail between our legs not some great show of strength this is hardly trump or bidens fault its just how it was at the time the reason biden gets shit on is because he apparently thought it was 2009 or something and decided to act like a hardass when he did have the resources or position to back it up	0.0	2024-09-03 09:55:58
