Lgsn1MLR	458474237	and i want real reasonsthe analysis is broken down into two parts 1 why do men join the military in the first place 2 how are these conditions not being honor and glory the main reason men join is for honor and glory in social status the concept that when a medal winner returns home he is greeted with a ticker tape parade different companies compete to hire him and women beg for his affections this used to be the case old enough to remember wwii vets that were still wearing their uniforms and medals to the grocery store at 80 years old because it made them a rock star to that generation my uncle won the silver star for bravery twice and when he showed up it was like elvis or taylor swift or someone walked in those men expected that kind of treatment because that was how civil war vets were treated in their 5 discount at lowes aside they are not treated like that anymore tearing down statues from that era effects them to a degree but what really effects them is seeing vietnam vets spit on and called baby killer and nooticing that every power broker biden and trump both were all draft dodgers this can not be fixed overnight because it takes a generation or so to build a martial culture that respects vets and no saying thank you for your service to a homeless vet just cut treatment while in the service military service tends to run in families and you can be very sure young men thinking of joining ask their veteran relatives what they can expect vaccine mandates hurt the services a lot imagine being a ten year veteran of the navy seals risking torture and death and then recieving a dishonorable cq0chnowte667rugdei hurts this but not because fags fight or something because promoting people based on anything other that combat efficiency discourages everyone from working hard when they clearly see that your promotion is guaranteed	1.0	2024-02-12 22:22:38
