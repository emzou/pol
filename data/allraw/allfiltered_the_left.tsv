KZfXz9H9	399596001	i mean  idk maybe  lol  my thinking for why it exists is that it has to do with policy  republicans  in the end  are known to support any policy that they believe disproportionately hurts black people  gays or minorities  theyll support those policies even if they hurt themselves  badly   imagine a poor person in appalachia  living in a trailer  and opposing universal healthcare cuz he  dont want no niggers to get it    so people understand that and they say  jesus christ  republicans must really profoundly hate black people   thus the double standard begins to exist for themwhen irl for us on the left  we all understand race tensions  we all understand a lot of difficulty of multiculturalism or why it s hard for people to work through  and even why white people are upset about it  but if a republican ever says the same thing  people tweak 	1.0	2022-10-12 22:28:51
w6iJX0ta	401851993	the reason i want wfh is because both houses are in rural locations  rather good ones too  my parents are not poor in retirement  still  the economic opportunities are limited  if my plan works i could live by working some menial job at a grovery store eventually if i have to  of course you ll never have the  status  you can attain if you cut your dick off and become a dei whatever the fuck but hey its a survival at least  i find no satisfaction or joy in the greater society so i have accepted my life will be spent watching the wests deterioration  i ve spent my entire life telling my peers where things will be going  and have gotten insulted for it while i ve been proven right all along but the lag is so long they get rewarded for compliance while i get left behind  so i ve seen that you re rewarded for short term correctness at the expense of the health of the culture as a whole  i do nt know if i d describe myself as bitter but i ve given up on a society that is stupid  and i include both the left and right in this  the left is degenerate while much of the right is stuck in the past acting like bootstraps and merit still matter watching politics like a sport pretending it will change anything  i ve washed my hands of it all  	0.0	2022-10-28 04:41:07

	482457381	i break it down basically all this identity politics stuff came about during occupy wallstreet wealthy executives were seeing the left and right unite against corporations it was dangerous for their bottom line this is why they pushed identity politics identity politics have no real effect on fiscal policy the wealthy get to keep their money and the poors get to fight over whether they think trannies are good or bad the poors believe this fight matters so they do bother with the real issue at hand this ties in to blackrock blackrock has their fingers in every pie they invested into pretty much every major corporation you know same goes for vanguard and state street the push for dei in the workspace is primarily a union busting technique if everyone in the warehouse is racist you are getting mad at the boss you getting mad at the coworker as far as hollywood goes it done for agitation the writers on most contemporary projects are the nepotism children of the wealthy they have no real sense of how to critique capital because they themselves benefit from the system so instead they push identity politics because it eases their conscience because they believe it something that actually matters then you have the stuff like gingers being cast as black and arabs being cast as indians these are related to zionism since both groups generally hate israel when it comes to attractive women in games it much the same as the writers in hollywood they are either ignorant of or unwilling to critique the system as a whole so putting an ugly woman in a game to them is peak political praxis the thing is the whole thing is inevitably self defeating like it or not the reason most people hate trannies is for any real ideological reason they just think they fucking cross and ugly that creates a market for making people not look as gross and ugly	2.0	2024-09-21 17:52:42
